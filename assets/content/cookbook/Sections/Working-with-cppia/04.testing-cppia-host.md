# Testing the cppia host executable

Navigate to the **/bin** folder and start the application from the terminal. 
On Windows, typically run `Host.exe`, and on Linux/Mac run `./Host`.

This should start the application, and the following should be written to the terminal:

`> Host.hx:4: Hello from Cppia Host`  
`> Script.hx:4: Hello from Cppia SCRIPT`


This indicates that the host has run (traced its own message) and executed the script (traced the script message).

If you get the following message, the host can't find the script file:

`> Error: [file_contents,./script.cppia]`

Make sure that you have followed the **Creating a cppia script** tutorial, and that the **script.cppia** is placed in the same folder as your Host executable.
