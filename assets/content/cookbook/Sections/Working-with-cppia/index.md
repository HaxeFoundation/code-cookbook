# Working with cppia

**Cppia** is a scriptable "cpp subtarget" for [Haxe](http://haxe.org), created by [Hugh Sanderson](https://twitter.com/GameHaxe).
Information about cppia can be found in Hugh's [WWX2015 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hltXpZ3Upxg) (cppia part starts around 15:45).

A **cppia script** is a "instructions assembly" script that can be run inside a **cppia host**, and gives you Neko JIT runtime speed at near-zero compilation time. It also lets add performance critical code to the host, wich gives you full cpp runtime speed for those parts.
