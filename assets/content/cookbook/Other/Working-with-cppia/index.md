# Working with cppia

This article is about cppia, a scriptable "cpp subtarget" for [Haxe](https://haxe.org). A _cppia script_ is a "instructions assembly" script that can be run inside a _cppia host_ and gives you Neko JIT runtime speed at near-zero compilation time. It also lets add performance critical code to the host, wich gives you full cpp runtime speed for those parts.

Information about cppia can be found in [Hugh Sanderson](https://twitter.com/GameHaxe)s [WWX2015 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hltXpZ3Upxg) (cppia part starts around 15:45).
