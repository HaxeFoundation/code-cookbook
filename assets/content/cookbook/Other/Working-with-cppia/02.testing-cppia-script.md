# Testing our cppia script

For testing purposes, the **haxelib hxcpp** installation includes a Cppia host program wich can
be used to test simple scripts.

Navigate to the **/bin** folder, and run the following command:

`> haxelib run hxcpp script.cppia`

This should output the following in the console:

`> Script.hx:4: Hello from Cppia SCRIPT`

Now, we know that our script works and can be executed by an cppia host.
