To create complex 3D models within your browser a texture is applied over a mesh of triangles. The triangle is a basic structure for WebGL graphics ( and OpenGL graphics ).
This tutorial will only cover simple rendering of triangles the most basic use of shaders in a 2D context.  WebGL actually works in 3d but we will concentrate on triangles where all the corners have the same z value, and only transform the whole 2D shape in 3D.

##Shaders

WebGL works by running Shaders on your graphics card in parrallel, your graphics card is designed to be able to do lots of simple calculations all at the same time. The graphics card allows you to draw very complex scenes on the screen very fast by breaking the task into lots of tasks it can do all at the same time.  Shader are just simple c code uploaded to your GPU that can processes triangles into pixels, commonly a two step process. The two steps first to use a Vertex Shader, and then the second to apply a Pixel Shader.

### Vertex Shader - First Step

The first processing step is to pass triangles and other parameters to the Vertex Shader.  The vertex shader runs the calculations you ask of it 3 times for each corner of each triangle within the scene you want to render to the screen.

Typically we use the Vertex Shader to calculate the positions of the 3D triangles as a 4D vector ( vec4 ) eg: x, y, z, w. We will ignore "w" because it's not that relevant to what we are doing and beyond scope of this tutorial.

So we may define the position of each corner with one line of code, values for each axis are normally between -1 and 1.

```code
   gl_Position = modelViewProjection * vec4(pos, 1.0);
```

The Vertex shader helps us by calculating values to pass to the Fragment Shader.

### Fragment Shader - Second Step

The second step of processing is the Fragment Shader to take the 4D vector and map it to the 2D screen as pixels.  This is often where we process textures/colors of our triangle. This process runs once per pixel in the triangle so it's lucky it's done in parallel because otherwise it would take ages. This is also a 4D vector of Red, Green, Blue and Alpha ranging from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates saturation.

```code
    gl_FragColor = col;
```
## Visualizing the two step Shader process.

This diagram shows the flow of data in the form of triangles, colors and transformations to the actual pixels we see on the screen.
